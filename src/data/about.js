        "I am a second-year university student studying BSc Computer Science at King's College London.",
        "Creating innovative solutions and products was always a hobby of mine. At a young age, I was introduced to programming, which I got hooked on almost instantly. Being able to use microcontrollers to drive different hardware devices opened an entire dimension of opportunities that presents with bigger and better projects. With the fair amount of experience I gathered from my past projects throughout the years, I would say I can build a pretty decent robot that serves its function.",
        "Another hobby of mine is table tennis. I started training when I was a young boy, only starting to play competitively when I got into middle school. I'm currently representing my university team which really is a great honour."

        "The hunger and determination in problem-solving enabled me to hone various programming skills efficiently.",
        "I was first introduced to procedural programming with languages such as C and C++ mainly to build simple robots with arduinos. Then I was taught to build webpages with HTML and PHP with the support of CSS and JavaScript. In my first year of university, I was introduced to object-oriented programming in Java and as of now, my second year in university, I had the opportunity to revisit c++, which further polished my programming skills and enriched my knowledge on more complex alogrithms and data structures.",
        "Apart from university work, I am now working on my app development skills in React Native, a JavaScript-based mobile app development framework supported and powered by Facebook",
